# Python Windows Printer Setter
Just a small TKinter app to help old people easily change printers. Compatible with as old as Windows 7.

## DISCLAIMER
It literally has a Python 2.7 included. Cared more about backwards compatibility than making it compact, but in a world where the dumbest apps are 300 mbs + because people need an entire copy of javascript engine in order for their app to work, I believe both God and Terry Davis will forgive my app for being ~100 mbs.

## How to run:
Just run start.vbs. Yeah, that simple. No, you don't need any other dependencies, I just wrote above that you have an entire Python 2.7 interpreter bundled. Go nuts.
